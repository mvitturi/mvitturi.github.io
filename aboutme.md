### ik ben mattia

Ciao! I am Mattia Vitturi.
I am an Italian enthusiast software developer who worked in Malta and now lives in The Netherlands. I share my free time between my growing family, my dumb dog and some nerd hobbies (coding, gaming, painting miniatures).

### this blog is for ...

... me. 
I am totally fine you discover in here something useful, but it's mainly meant for me to keep notes and tracks of my progresses. I will speak about my coding experiments, cool stuff I find around, design concepts and tricks to simplify my daily coding life.
